# First-Fit-algorithm
This is demonstration of First Fit algorithm in shell script as well as in C.
First Fit Algorithm is the simplest technique of allocating the memory block to the processes amongst all. In this algorithm, the pointer keeps track of all the free blocks in the memory and accepts the request of allocating a memory block to the coming process.
